**Intro**

This project is called Around The U.S. It is practice for using grid display, font face, media queries, and the program Figma. I also maintained my familiarity with flexbox and importing css files. The project was also scaled for task management.

**Improvements**
An improvement that can be made on this project is allow users to choose the sequence images are displayed. This way they can organize how they want.
